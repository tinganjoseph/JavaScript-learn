/**
 * *The simplest operators in JavaScript are unary operators. A unary operator works on one operand. The unary operators in JavaScript are: 
 * !1. Unary plus(+) - convert an operand into a number
 * !2. Unary minus(-) - convert an operand into a number and negate the value after that.
 * !3. prefix/ postfix increments(++) - add one to its operand.
 * !4. prefix/ postfix decrements(--) - substract one from its operand.
 * 
 * todo: Note: an operand is any object capable of being manipulated. For example, in "1 + 2" the "1" and "2" are the operands
