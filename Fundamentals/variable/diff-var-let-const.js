//*different bet var, let and const

/**
 * var: can be override 
 * let: can be reassign
 * const: is for read-only
 * 
 * ? var and let create variables that can be reassigned another value.const creates "constant" variables that cannot be reassigned another value.developers shouldn't use var anymore. They should use let or const instead.if you're not going to change the value of a variable, it is good practice to use const
