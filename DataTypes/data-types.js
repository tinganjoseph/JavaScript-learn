/**
 * !Javascript has six primitive data types:
 * *1. null
 * *2. undefined
 * *3. boolean
 * *4. number
 * *5. string
 * *6. symbol-available only from ES6
 * ?and one comple data type is called object
 */

//Todo: Javascript is a dynamic language therefore a variable doesn't associate with any type. However, its value does.
